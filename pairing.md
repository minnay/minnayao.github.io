<!-- Some things are best done alone, like changing a light bulb and taking selfies. Other activities, however, lend themselves to a group dynamic. Programming, for example, may seem like a solitary operation, but more and more organizations are seeing the benefits of pair programming

# waste of resource?

<!-- it isn’t just a technique where one person programs and the other person watches. It’s much slower. Talking through approaches and trying to agree on an implementation takes up a fair amount of time. Sometimes you just want to knuckle down get something done - not gonna happen. Obviously the two people could be programming in parallel on different problems. -->

# sharing is awful; and hygenie!

<!-- Sharing computers and desks is awful. What if everyone needs to use the computer at lunch time and there are not enough to go around?1 What if you have carefully configured some apps on one machine but someone else is using it today? -->

<!-- Some people are not as hygienic as others and you will be using the same keyboard and mouse - be prepared to share coughs and colds. Some people are tidier than others, leaving food and other things on the desk is no problem if it’s your desk but can be quite annoying for others. -->

# Signs to watch out for good pairing

---
- greasy finger-marks on the screen and loud conversation <!-- (communication) -->

- "No, let me show you what I mean." <!-- ( "expert programmer theory" - where the members of the pair perceive each other as knowledgeable problems are solved more effectively)
 -->

- "Oh, you’ve left out the comma here" <!-- (Notice More Details. the person who isn’t typing code always picks up typos quicker) -->

- "Are we heading in the right direction?"

# Pair programming is a social skill

class: middle

- Realise that it is a hard thing to do!

- Not everyone is born with the skill. you need to learn if you want it to be effective

- It will take time to pay off

<!-- it is a cooperative relationship that takes time to hone but ultimately pays off. As one blogger puts it, it’s a social skill that takes some getting used to. But like all acquired skills, once you’ve developed a taste, there’s no turning back. -->
